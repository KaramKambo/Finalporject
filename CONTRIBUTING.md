## Commits
Commits are to be used by the project contributors in order to work on minor issues and small features. Typically, it's best to use commits when working on features or issues that don't affect other aspects of the project, usually that are contained to just one file and few lines of code.  
### Instructions
The main contributors of the project use IntelliJ Idea as the IDE for this project. In IntelliJ, the commit process is quite simple.

The procedure for Commiting using IntelliJ is to 
- commit, using the check mark (circled red)
- pull using the blue arrow (circled blue)
- push to github using the up arrow (circled green.) 
Commits can also be done directly through github. These commits should be done specifically for editing markdown files or making one word changes in code. 
### Use Situations
Commits should be used only when editing very minor files or creating minor features or styling on the project. This is in order to avoid merge conflicts that result in other contributors losing work and code. In the event that a major features needs to be added or changed, it is best to create a new branch and pull request to merge the project. 
## Pull Requests
This project will henceforth use pull requests and branching as the primary way to avoid merge conflicts and contribute to the project.
