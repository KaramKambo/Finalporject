|Pair Prototyping / Thymeleaf.  Try using Class objects in Thymeleaf.    Most simple Class would be to use String methods (Links to an external site.) and Number methods, (Links to an external site.) more complex is to use your own defined Class include Images or other Media.   Objective is to produce a 3 by 3 grid using Bootstrap Grids, Bootstrap Tables, Bootstrap Cards.  Try to incorporate into Project or consider as Mini Lab depending on your design.  Try changing 3 x 3 to 4 x 4 or other orientation would be showing ability to manage page dynamically.| [Ticket](https://github.com/4disease/p1-donuts-new/issues/18) & [Screenshot](https://github.com/4disease/p1-donuts-new#screeshots) |

## Ideation/Brainwrite
OWe had our design brainstorming session today talking about the design ideas for our website. Our group finalized a traveling design for our website which includes all of the seven continents and popular tourist destinations at those locations. Some of these tourist destinations include high rated restaurants, the seven wonders of the world, historical must-sees, and even locations to relax. The information to follow is all visible at this link with our wireframe: Wireframe for App - Coders
As is visible, we have a cover page, with our FAQs, mini-labs, and About Us page. All of these buttons lead us to different screens with the corresponding information. We plan to have a “scroll more” button that gives options for traveling, one of which is the seven continents. We plan to have a drop down menu labeled ‘Continents’ and we would have the seven continents drop down from that bar. Once you click on a certain continent, the website will direct you to the options listed above. There will be a contact us section of the website where users can reach us if they have any questions regarding their trip. From there, you can plan your perfect trip to one of the wonderful seven continents!
